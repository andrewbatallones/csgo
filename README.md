# Computer Science (go) or csgo

As I go through my notes, I want to document and rewrite some of the stuff I learned in some of my computer science courses and put them here.

## Leetcode

I've also put my leetcode attempts here. A lot of them will probably be messy as I start, but should quickly get better and cleaner.

## Examples

Here is where I'll put other coding challenges that I didn't find on leetcode.

## Golang

This package will be more about Golang specific things.
